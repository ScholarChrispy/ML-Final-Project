## **Project Goals & Outline:**
The goal of this project is to use various neural network models to perform sentiment analysis on tweets, and make decisions on whether their sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. We would then compare the performance of the models, and make a decision on which one we would recommend.

### Outline:
1. Data Importing and Preprocessing
2. Model Construction
   1. Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (BRNN)
   2. Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM)
   3. Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
3. Model Training
   1. Training BRNN
   2. Training Bidirectional LSTM Network
   3. Training GRU Network
4. Model Analysis, Comparison and Conclusions
   1. Analysis of BRNN Model
   2. Analysis of Bidirectional LSTM Model
   3. Analysis of GRU Model
   4. Model Comparison
